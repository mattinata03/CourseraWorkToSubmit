## Question 4:
## Across the United States, how have emissions from coal
## combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

## Load the raw data files.

NEI <- readRDS("exdata-data-NEI_data/summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("exdata-data-NEI_data/Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Subset the SCC file for sources that are coal combustion-related
# First subset SCC for sources from combustion sources

cSCC <- SCC[grep("[Cc]omb", SCC$EI.Sector, value = FALSE),]

# Then subset the combustion sources for those using coal

cCoalSCC <- cSCC[grep("[Cc]oal",
                            cSCC$EI.Sector, value = FALSE),]

# Subset the NEI data for data sourced only from coal combustion-related
# sources.

cCoalNEI_US <- subset(NEI, NEI$SCC %in% cCoalSCC$SCC)


## Aggregate the NEI data, summing emissions by year


cCoalPM25_US <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year,
                                  cCoalNEI_US, sum)

## Create plot of PM2.5 coal combustion-related emissions
## for the US, with chart showing PM2.5 total emissions by year
## Add a linear model smooth line to see trend in Data
## (dividing total emissions by 10,000 so y axis values are easier to read)
## Save output to a png file
